Cool Science
================

Cool Science is the Science North blog. We're experimenting with moving to Ruby and open-sourcing as much of our work as possible. This repo is our first step.

## In Other Wordsâ€¦

You probably don't want to clone this repo for any high-end work. We're making zero effort to make this repo relevant to anyone other than the writers and readers of Cool Science. But if you've ever wanted a sneak peak at how we do things, or if you see anything on Cool Science and want to know how it works, here's your chance.
